MakeMap.py
1. Collect active buoys in defined range
2. Get swell data from those buoys
3. Plot buoy map with swell arrows
4. Plot time series swell size, period, and direction data for collected buoys
5. Make scatter plots over previous 45 days (swell period vs swell size)


Still need:
1. Function to grab buoy data for particular date and time
2. Function to produce map arrows based on swell height and period
3. Time series plots
4. Scatter plots

WVHT & APD are averages
SwH & SwP seem to be one-time measurements at some point during 20 minute interval
